INDIA: In a heartwarming story of love and dedication, 22-year-old Kanpur paan seller Abhishek Yadav surprised his wife with a precious gift bought entirely from coins he had painstakingly saved. 

Working at his Pan stall, he collected every Rs. 10 and Rs. 20 coin he received, day after day, for over a year. His quiet perseverance culminated in two sacks filled with coins, totaling over Rs. 1 lakh. 

With this, he visited a jewellery shop in Ahirwan Raja Market and purchased a gold chain worth around $1.25 lakh, paying with the coins and arranging installments for the remainder. 

This thoughtful gesture reflects not just financial discipline, but also deep devotion, patience, and the quiet sacrifices that often go unnoticed in everyday life, proving that love is built as much on effort and intent as on grand gestures.👏🏽
