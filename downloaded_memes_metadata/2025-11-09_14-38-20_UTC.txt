65 million years ago, an asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs — or so we’re told.☄️

But some theorists ask:
> What if it wasn’t just a rock? What if it was a massive spacecraft, crashing from deep space?🤔

Imagine: an ancient alien civilization fleeing extinction, their ship colliding with Earth by accident or by design. The resulting impact changes the planet forever - triggering the end of the dinosaurs and clearing the way for mammals... and eventually, us.🛸

Maybe the survivors of that crash adapted. Maybe their DNA merged and evolved, leading to humanity as we know it today.

Think about it👀👽
